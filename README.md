# Master-Frame-CSS
```
This project presents usage of a CSS framework called bootstrap. Bootstrap uses a grid system. For this webpage to be functional, this webpage had to flow along with this grid system. The objective of this project is to present a responsive webpage that will look presentable on all or any width of a browser. There are components taken from getbootstrap.com that allow this to happen, by providing its own complete CSS framework to work from. There is also a personal CSS page that was made and used to modify the bootstrap CSS framework implemented. With all these components, a responsive webpage about myself, my portfolio and a place for your contact information were created.
